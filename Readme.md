## Getting Started With Style Guide Boilerplate

### Hook up your own CSS into the style guide
In the `<head>` of **Style Guide Boilerplate** are custom styles for the boilerplate itself. These have all been prefixed with sg- so they hopefully shouldn't cause any conflicts with your website's own styles.

Below the custom styles for the boilerplate, you will add in your own custom stylesheet(s) which you use on your live site.

    <!-- Style Guide Boilerplate Styles -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/sg-style.css">
	  
    <!-- Replace below stylesheet with your own stylesheet -->
    <link rel="stylesheet" href="css/style.css">

## Browser Support
I've built **Style guide ToT** with progressive enhancement in mind to work on a wide range of browsers.

Known supported browsers include:

* Chrome
* Firefox
* Safari 
* Opera 
* IE6+
* Stock Android Browser (4.0+)
* Chrome for Android
* Firefox for Android
* Opera Mini
* Opera Mobile
* Safari for iOS
* Chrome for iOS

If you come across any bugs, or have any other issues with the boilerplate, please open an issue here on GitHub.
